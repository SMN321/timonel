Timonel TWI master - Multi slave
================================

This test application [shows](https://youtu.be/PM9X1thrdOY) the usage of TWI master libraries.

It is a serial console-based application, Arduino-compatible, that runs a 3-time loop that flashes, deletes and runs a user application on three Tiny85's (two bare chips and a Digispark).

The application has been tested on ESP-01 and NodeMCU modules. It is compiled and flashed to the device using __PlatformIO__ over __VS Code__.
