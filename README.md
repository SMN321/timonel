## ATtiny85 I2C Bootloader

Timonel is an I2C bootloader for ATtiny85/45/25 microcontrollers. It is designed to enable AVR firmware updates in scenarios where there is a more powerful MCU (ESP8266, Arduino, RPi, BeagleBone, etc.) serving as I2C master and one or more ATtiny85 as I2C slaves that perform peripheral functions.

Some cases:

* A small robot controlled by an ESP32 where each limb specific functions are delegated to several Tiny85 through an I2C bus.
* Multisensor IoT setups, where each Tiny85 is a node that handles one or more sensors.
* etc ...

In these situations, it is quite convenient to be able to update the AVRs' firmware directly from a single entry point, the I2C master. Depending on the main microcontroller type, the ATtiny updates can even be done wirelessly. However, until now (mid-2018), there doesn't seem to be an I2C bootloader that directly suits the TinyX5 family, addressing its various limitations:

* It does not have dedicated hardware to handle I2C, only the USI (Universal Serial Interface).
* Lacks a bootloader protected memory area.
* Unable to redirect interrupt vectors to the bootloader.

That is why this project began ...

## Usage:

* [Install](/timonel-bootloader/README.md#Installation) "timonel.hex" on a Tiny85 (bare chips or Digisparks).
* Compile your [application program](/apps) and convert the generated ".hex" into an array of bytes to be included in "timonel-twim-ss" or "timonel-twim-ms" (e.g. uint8\_t payload[size] = { 0xaa, 0xbb, ...}; ). Use "[tml-hexparser](/timonel-hexparser)" for helping to create the array (payload).
* Use [VS Code](http://code.visualstudio.com) + [PlatformIO](http://platformio.org) to compile and install "[timonel-twim-ss.bin](/timonel-twim-ss)" or "[timonel-twim-ms.bin](/timonel-twim-ms)" (containing the payload) in an arduino-compatible MCU. It has been tested with ESP8266 ESP01 and NodeMCU. **Note:** the ".bin" file provided contains a small payload demo that sends an SOS by blinking PB1.
* Connect both chips by **I2C** (SDA, SCL and ground).
* Open an asynchronous terminal (e.g. [MobaXterm](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net)) connected to the serial port of the I2C master (9600 N 8 1).
* Run the commands shown on screen for erasing and flashing new firmware on the Tiny85.
* It is also possible to update the bootloader itself by using "[timonel-updater](/timonel-updater)" (based on the micronucleus upgrade program).

## Version History:

**v1.5** \- 2020\-07\-03: Functional Release: Optional commands READEEPR and WRITEEPR have been added to read and write data to the EEPROM as well as the READDEVS command that allows reading the device signature, fuses, and lock bits. A few code fixes and a "pre-main" startup file reduction allows getting an additional flash memory page for applications. The overall project repository was restructured, now the I2C libraries and examples are held on separate git repositories to handle the versioning independently. Added an experimental [PlatformIO project](/timonel-bootloader-io) folder to handle the bootloader building in a more structured way. However, for the moment, the [Make version](/timonel-bootloader) is still the recommended one.

**v1.4** \- 2019\-10\-29: Functional Release: Significant memory saving by inlining the TWI driver functions\, now the smaller version "tml\-t85\-small" occupies less than 1 kB\, leaving 7 kB available for user applications\. Speed improvement through a code tuning to transmit 32\-byte packets \(half a page of memory in a Tiny85\)\. User\-application "**autorun**" is now optional. Internal clock configuration support improved. [Interactive master](/timonel-twim-ss) test program improved with streamlined libs (see it [working](http://youtu.be/-7GOMToGvzI)). [Multi-slave master](/timonel-twim-ms) test program added (see it [working](http://youtu.be/PM9X1thrdOY)).

**v1.3** \- 2019\-06\-06: Functional Release: Bootloader inline functions \(smaller code\) and low fuse auto clock tweaking\.Â Support for 1\, 2\, 8 and 16 MHz clock speed in user\-application mode\. TWI master UploadApplication refactoring\, now supports both types of page address calculation and both modes of **APP\_USE\_TPL\_PG**. Several bug fixes.

**v1.2** \- 2019\-05\-15: Functional Release: "Good\-neighbor" behavior fixes data dump operation interferences among Timonel devices in multi\-device bus setups\. The TWI master functionality has been packed in a couple of Arduino libraries to ease the handling of the several configuration options\. Timonel\-master\-ss firmware shows its usage\. The TWI master code was moved to PlatformIO\.

**v1.1** \- 2018\-10\-29: Functional Release: Optional ReadFlash command added\. Minor tweaks for running Timonel @ 8 MHz\.

**v1.0** \- 2018\-10\-05: Functional Release: Optional features implemented\.

**v0.9** \- 2018\-09\-29: Functional pre\-release: Temporary page buffer and other minor issues solved\.

**v0.8** \- 2018\-09\-16: First functional pre\-release\.

**v0.7** \- 2018\-09\-07: Non\-functional\.
