# Timonel Bootloader v1.5

Changes from previous version:

* **Slightly smaller bootloader footprint:** some memory got by removing unused pre-checks from the "crt1.S" initialization file (before calling main), and tweaking compiler options. Now smallest bootloader size, when compiled using the "tml-t85-small" @8Mhz configuration, is ~880 bytes (less than 14 pages). This leaves **7.3 Kbytes (114 pages) available for the user application** on an ATtiny85.
* **Transmission speed improvement:** the code was adjusted to allow the bootloader to transmit and receive 32-byte packets (Half memory-page on an ATtiny85). This produces a significant performance increase to the user application upload and flash memory reading functions.
* **User application autorun is now optional:** implemented by adding a APP\_AUTORUN feature to allow selecting whether the user application will run automatically after a timeout when the bootloader is not initialized, or, it will only be run controlled by the TWI master. The CHECK\_EMPTY\_FL optional feature was deprecated since the READFLSH command can be used for the same purpose. Improved command reply switch-case.
* **Different internal-clock configurations support improved:** now the bootloader adapts its clock speed by modifying the OSCCAL register to compensate fuse configurations in 1, 2 and 8 MHz (At 16 Mhz it works without any type of compensation). This can be done in two ways:
    1. The compensation is configured at the time of bootloader compilation by setting the LOW\_FUSE variable.
    2. It adapts at runtime by directly reading the value of the low fuse. This last mode is selected by enabling "AUTO\_CLK\_TWEAK". It allows the bootloader to continue working without recompiling despite changing the fuses settings, but it takes a little more memory. In both cases, the bootloader restores the original configuration after its execution so that the application can function at the speed for which it was designed.

## Compilation

The **"make-timonel.sh"** script allows launching "[make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make)" with different configurations. It has several arguments, including **"--all"**, which compiles all the preconfigured options found in the **"configs"** directory. The flashable **".hex"** binary files are saved in the **"releases"** directory.

E.g: <b>`./make-timonel.sh tml-t85-small timonel 13 1B80 1 false;`</b>

* Generates a **"timonel.hex"** binary file based on **"tml-t85-small"** config.
* Assigns the TWI address **13**Â to the device in bootloader mode.
* Sets **0x1B80** as the bootloader start memory position.
* Sets the device low fuse to operate at **1 MHz** in user-application mode.
* **Disables** automatic clock tweaking.

**Note:** This bootloader version has been compiled with the **"avr-gcc 8.3.0 64-bit"** toolchain downloaded from [this site](http://blog.zakkemble.net/avr-gcc-builds)., it's also included under the "[avr-toolchains](http://github.com/casanovg/avr-toolchains)" repository. The scripts are included mainly to ease to repetitive work of flashing several devices but, of course, the bootloader can be compiled and flashed using avr-gcc and avrdude directly.

## <a id="Installation"></a>Flashing Timonel on the device

The **"flash-timonel-bootloader.sh"** script allows flashing Timonel on the device by using the "[avrdude](http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/avrdude)" utility with an [AVR programmer](http://www.fischl.de/usbasp). The supported arguments are:

1. Binary file name (without ".hex" extension), located under "releases" directory.
2. Clock speed in MHz: 16, 8, 2, 1.
The bootloader can be flashed to bare ATtiny85/45/25 chips, Digispark boards and other Tiny85-compatible devices using an AVR programmer (e.g. USBasp).

E.g: <b>`./flash-timonel-bootloader.sh timonel 1;`</b>

* Flashes **"timonel.hex"** binary file on the device with avrdude.
* Sets the device's low fuse to run at **1 MHz** (possible values are 1, 2, 8 and 16).

## Setting optional features

The bootloader has several optional features that allow finding the right balance between characteristics, flash memory usage, and performance. They're enabled from the configuration file **"tml-config.mak"** placed inside specific configuration folders (e.g. "tml-t85-cfg", the default one). It's a makefile include that adds or removes sections of the source code that will be part of the ".hex" binary file when compiling it. As a general rule of thumb, more enabled features = bigger bootloader size = less space for user applications. The available options are briefly described below:

* **ENABLE\_LED\_UI**: If this is enabled, the GPIO pin defined by LED\_UI\_PIN is used to display Timonel activity when certain functions are run. This is useful mainly for debugging. PLEASE DISABLE THIS FOR PRODUCTION! IT COULD ACTIVATE SOMETHING CONNECTED TO A POWER SOURCE BY ACCIDENT! (Default: false).
* **AUTO\_PAGE\_ADDR**: Automatic page and trampoline address calculation. If this option is enabled, the bootloader will auto-increase the uploaded data pages addresses when receiving an application from the TWI (I2C) master and it will calculate the trampoline needed to jump to the application on exit. On the other hand, when this is disabled the bootloader becomes smaller but this task is transferred to the TWI master, so this one has to calculate the page addresses and the trampoline. With this option disabled, enabling CMD\_SETPGADDR becomes mandatory, otherwise, the TWI master won't be able to set the pages addresses, the application upload wouldn't be possible. (Default: true).
* **APP\_USE\_TPL\_PG**: This option enables the user application to use the trampoline page when AUTO\_PAGE\_ADDR is enabled. This is more a kind of safety measure than a true memory stretching since enabling this takes 2 extra memory pages. In the end, disabling this allows 1 extra page. If AUTO\_PAGE\_ADDR is disabled, this option is irrelevant since the trampoline page writing duty is transferred to the I2C master. (Default: false).
* **CMD\_SETPGADDR**: When this is enabled, the TWI master can define the starting address of every application memory page being uploaded. If it's disabled, enabling AUTO\_PAGE\_ADDR becomes mandatory. In such cases, applications can only be flashed starting from page 0 since the page address auto-increase works that way. This is OK for most applications. (Default: false).
* **TWO\_STEP\_INIT**: If this is enabled, Timonel expects a two-step initialization from an I2C master before running the exit, memory erase and write commands. This is a safety measure to avoid an unexpected bootloader initialization, which enables memory functions, due to bus noise. When it's disabled, only a single-step initialization is required. (Default: false).
* **USE\_WDT\_RESET**: If this is enabled, the bootloader uses the watchdog timer for resetting instead of jumping to TIMONEL\_START. This reset is more similar to a power-on reset. It could be useful to start the user application from a "cleanest" state if required. (Default: true).
* ~~**CHECK\_EMPTY\_FL**: If this is enabled, when running GETTMNLV command, the bootloader will read the first 100 flash memory positions to check if there is an application (or some other data) loaded in flash memory. The true/false outcome is informed as part of the GETTMNLV command reply packet. (Default: false)~~. **Deprecated  in v1.4!**
* **APP\_AUTORUN**: If this option is set to false, the uploaded user application will **NOT** start automatically after a timeout when the bootloader is not initialized. In such a case, the TWI master must launch the app execution (Default: true).
* **CMD\_READFLASH**: This option enables the READFLSH command, which is used by the TWI master for dumping the device's whole memory contents for debugging purposes. It can also be useful for backing up the flash memory before flashing a new firmware. (Default: false).
* **AUTO\_CLK\_TWEAK**: When this feature is enabled, the clock speed adjustment is made at run time based on the low fuse setup. It works only for internal CPU clock configurations: RC oscillator or HF PLL. (Default: false).
* **FORCE\_ERASE\_PG**: If this option is enabled, each flash memory page is erased before writing new data. Normally, it shouldn't be necessary to enable it. (Default: false).
* **CLEAR\_BIT\_7\_R31**: This is to avoid that the first bootloader instruction is skipped after restarting without an user application in memory. See: http://www.avrfreaks.net/comment/2561866#comment-2561866. (Default: false).
* **CHECK\_PAGE\_IX**: If this option is enabled, the page index size is checked to ensure that isn't bigger than SPM\_PAGESIZE (64 bytes in an ATtiny85). This keeps the app data integrity in case the master sends wrong page sizes. (Default: false).
